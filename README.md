Here I will do a kind of centralization of all the algorithms using jobs tests, 
but my real objective is make a local were all new programmers can prepare to 
you jobs tests.


I really hope to do something that a lot of people contribute and take as a
basis to prepare for your needs


You can contribute by creating a folder with a description of the exercise and
its resolution, similar to the others existing in the repository:

 - An exercise description file
 - A file with the same resolution
 - The language is indifferent

You can also add solutions for exercises already solved here however in other 
languages and if you can make code better, please add new a new script with 
resolutions for the exercises.

<b>Thank you for you contribution!</b> ❤️
